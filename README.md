## [0x00. Pagination](0x00-pagination)
This project focuses on pagination, which involves breaking down large amounts of data into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be delivered to clients in a structured way.

### :wrench: Project Setup
```bash
# Create project directory and README.
mkdir ./0x00-pagination/
touch ./0x00-pagination/README.md
cd 0x00-pagination
```
